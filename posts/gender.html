    <p class="post-content">After reading the article <i>Equal partnership between men and women in families</i>  here are some of my musings as to the concepts presented.</p>

    <p class="post-content">Within the Family a Proclamation to the World the following is written:</p>

    <blockquote>All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God.</blockquote>

    <p class="post-content">This is the truest form of equality that exists for any of us. Equality's definition is often confused with that of identity. The fact that everything is the same. Just as 2 + 3 = 5 equality means that both sides have something in common. For us humans we are all equal in the fact that we are all children of our Heavenly Father. But just as each part of the equation is different we each have our unique differences and quirks. These differences can be taken advantage of to make something that is better than what can be accomplished as an individual.</p>

    <p class="post-content">There is no greater difference then that of the different genders and there is no greater example of something great coming out of differences then a marriage where both parties are working together for a common goal. Each task can be split and delegated to the person who can best handle it.</p>

    <p class="post-content">To be able to do this both parties must listen and take each other into consideration when making decisions. Without this basic curtesy it is impossible for each to work towards a common goal.</p>
