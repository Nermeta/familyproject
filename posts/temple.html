    <p class="post-content">Temple covenants are an important part of Eternal Covenants and the behaviors they teach are an important to developing better relationships with those around us. </p>
    <p class="post-content">There are 5 covenants that are made within the Temple these are: The Law of Obedience, The Law of Sacrifice, The Law of the Gospel, The Law of Chastity, and the Law of Consecration. These laws applied in a family setting can lead to great benefits. The Law of Obedience is covenanting that we will keep God's commandments. These Commandments have always led to better things and all of them have to do with loving each other and loving God. The Law of Sacrifice means we do what we can to support each other and go through sincere repentance when we do wrong. Who would not benefit from such a sacrifice of the ego when we do wrong. The Law of the Gospel goes hand in hand with the Law of Obedience. It states that we follow the higher law that was taught while Christ was teaching upon the earth. The Law of Chastity states that we only have Sexual Relations with those who we are wedded to. This prevents all sorts of messy situations and unneeded heartache within the family setting. The Law of Consecration means we dedicate everything to building up The Church upon the Earth. In this context I take it to mean that you dedicate yourself to your spouse and eventually your children to build them up and help each other out.</p>
    <p class="post-content">These covenants are one of the key defining factors in determining a successful family and marriage. If we did the exact opposite of these things then relationships would degrade exponentially. Leading to all sorts of unneeded pain and heart ache.</p>
