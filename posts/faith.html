    <p class="post-content">Faith is a large part of family life. Without any sort of faith, if it be in a God, Science, Humanity, Ourselves, etc... We would not be able to have any sort of progress or relationships. While reading *Faith in Family life* I learned a couple of things about faith in the home.</p>
    <p class="post-content">The first thing I learned is that a significant point of contention between spouses is that of what church to attend. If both parents are religious but attend different faiths it can cause a lot more harm to children then if both parties didn't attend church at all. So it is important that both parents are of the same faith if possible.</p>
    <p class="post-content">It is also important to participate in rituals and traditions that bring faith into the home. These activities and consistency bring family members closer together and allows for bonding. It also leads to higher marital satisfaction if it is done voluntarily. Otherwise the activity's can seem arduous and can cause friction between family members.</p>
