    <p class="post-content">I have been personally working through some things that would be considered abuse. So I took an especially keen interest in this particular topic. I found a lot of useful information in <i> Understanding Abuse in Family Life.</i></p>

    <p class="post-content">It is important to define what abuse is. I personally use the following definition: "Actions that are intended to do harm or control another person". Now I would like to clarify that control is not the same as influence. Controlling another person is to take there agency away. Influencing does not take away another persons agency instead it provides other options for them to choose.</p>

    <p class="post-content">Healing from abuse is a very long and arduous process. It has 3 deceptively simple steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You have to be moved to a safe environment</li>
        <li>Make the decision if experts need to get involved</li>
        <li>Go through the process of forgiveness</li>
    </ol>
