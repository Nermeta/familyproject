    <p class="post-content">It has long been known that the most traditional role for women in the home is that of nurturer and that of a Mother. Within the chapter <i>Mothers as Nurtures</i> this concept is explored in depth. These are the ideas and thoughts that stood out to me after reading through it.</p>
    <p class="post-content">First off the role of a Mother in a child's life is fundamental to proper growth and development. There is no amount of prestige that can change that. It is something that is baked into the very foundations of this world.</p>
    <p class="post-content">Motherhood presents a very large opportunity for personal growth and development. There is much to learn and motherhood is one of the biggest opportunities to do so. It teaches an innumerable number of skills to those who take such roles seriously. </p>
