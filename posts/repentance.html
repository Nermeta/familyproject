    <p class="post-content">While reading <i> Repentance and Forgiveness in Family Life</i> I learned some pretty significant things. The main being the difference between Repentance and Forgiveness. There work hand in hand but they are independent of each other.</p>
    <p class="post-content">Repentance is all about giving up the old. So old habits, old patterns of thought, old actions, and creating newer healthier ones in its place. Writing the wrongs that we have created in the process. This process allows all of us to come closer to our Heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ. 
    </p>
    <p class="post-content">Now Forgiveness is very similar however there are some key differences. Forgiveness is letting go of all of the personal aspects and emotions associated with a particular wrong or act and deciding to move forward. This does not mean that a particular person is pardoned from the act. There is still justice that needs to be served, however it is not your responsibility to carry that out. It is a continual process not an end product. There are 5 steps to Forgiveness:</p>

    <ol class="post-content">
       <li> Understand the wrongs done</li>
       <li> Empathize with the other party</li>
       <li>Offer the gift of forgiveness</li>
       <li>Commit to Forgiveness</li>
       <li>Hold onto to the fact that they have been forgiven</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="post-content">An important aspect of both Repentance and Forgiveness is an Apology which has 4 parts:</p>

    <ol class="post-content">
        <li>A summation of the particular wrong done</li>
        <li>A sincere expression of regret</li>
        <li>An offer of repayment or restitution</li>
        <li>Pledge of a change of behavior</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="post-content">Without each of these pieces an apology is half hearted and will not lead to actual change.</p>
