    <p class="post-content">It is often discussed what the Mothers role in the family is, and many disregard the Fathers role in raising of a child. As someone who was raised almost exclusively by my mother I was also confused as to what the Father's role was in raising a child. After reading the chapter titled <i>Honor Thy Father Key Principles and Practices in Fathering</i>  here is what I learned.</p>
    <p class="post-content">The first thing I learned is that Father's do not have that same innate connection to there children as Mother's do. This makes sense to me since Mother's are almost exclusively responsible for a Child's wellbeing during pregnancy and for a while after birth. I had thought that Father's not having that connection was disadvantageous and meant that Father's may not be needed in the home.</p>
    <p class="post-content">This is not the case. Without this connection Father's have the ability to model how interactions work with people outside the home. This allows for them to teach important life lessons and social skills without having to wrestle with the emotions a Mother would have to do in the same situation.</p>
    <p class="post-content">The other big role that Father's have is to be providers. This means that they provide everything that is needed outside the home. Most take this to mean working and while that is certainly a big part of how modern families function, it also means protecting the family from outside dangers whenever possible.</p>
