    <p class="post-content">When I first was looking at work in family life I didn't think it helped with a whole lot. I am a particularly lazy person. However after reading through <i>Meaning and Blessings of Family Work</i>  I came to think differently.</p>

    <p class="post-content">Family work which mainly consist of chores is our first taste of service for other human  beings. It also has the added benefit of being for those who we are going to be closest with especially in the early years. It also gives space for family members to speak with one another while being productive and working on other aspects. </p>

    <p class="post-content">Work within the Family should not necessarily be about efficiency. If it was one of the most efficient ways maybe to just have the adults do all the chores. This however means that the children do not learn valuable skills and lessons in there early years.</p>

    <p class="post-content">It is also important to remember that plans are a means to an end not an end goal. They can go awry they can be changed and adjusted as needed. It is not a moral failing to do so.</p>
